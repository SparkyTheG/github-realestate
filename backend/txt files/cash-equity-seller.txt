## Failed Solutions

### What They Tried

- Loan modification - denied
- Talked to family - can't help

### Why It Failed

- Buyers can't get financing
- Timeline too aggressive

### Remaining Hope Assessment
Low - they've exhausted obvious options, need creative solution

---

## Desired Outcome Clarity

### What Success Means to Them
- Payment obligation gone
- Credit protected or minimally impacted
- Can move on with life
- Some equity preserved if possible

### Trade-offs (Speed vs Price vs Certainty)
- Will trade maximum price for speed and certainty
- Will consider creative terms for relief
- Willing to walk away with little to nothing

### What They Want Off Their Plate
- Monthly payment burden
- Maintenance responsibility
- Emotional stress
- Barrier to next chapter

---

## Openness to Creative Solutions

### Permission-Based Bridge Questions
- If I could solve your main problem, would how we do it matter?
- Are you more interested in the destination or the journey?
- Would you be willing to explore options you haven't heard of?
- What would make you comfortable with a non-traditional approach?

### If Openness is Low
Return to pain and failed options. Contrast where they are vs where they want to be. Creative solutions become attractive when traditional options are exhausted.

### Structure: Seller Finance
**Best Fit:** Rare for owner-occupied, only if equity + want income
**Primary Lever:** Monthly income stream

## Common Closer Mistakes

### Mistake: Explaining too early
**Why:** Presenting structure before understanding pain removes leverage and creates confusion
**Instead:** Complete discovery fully - earn the right to present solutions

### Mistake: Leading with strategy
**Why:** Prospects care about relief, not mechanisms. Strategy-first creates skepticism
**Instead:** Lead with outcome transformation, explain structure only when asked

### Mistake: Selling terms instead of relief
**Why:** Terms are abstract. Relief is visceral. Wrong focus = low conversion
**Instead:** Anchor to their pain point and desired outcome, terms are delivery vehicle

### Mistake: Presenting Subject-To prematurely
**Why:** Without proper framing, Subject-To sounds risky or too good to be true
**Instead:** Build trust, demonstrate understanding, frame as proven solution
