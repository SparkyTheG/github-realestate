---

## Failed Solutions

### What They Tried
- Hired property manager - still too involved
- Improved tenant screening - still issues
- Raised rents - still not worth it
- Put on market - price vs condition gap

### Why It Failed
- Problem is landlording itself, not execution
- Property manager adds cost without solving stress
- Market timing not right for retail sale
- Condition requires investment they won't make

### Remaining Hope Assessment
None - they're done, need exit solution that works

---

## Desired Outcome Clarity

### What Success Means to Them
- Hands completely off the property
- Either lump sum or truly passive income
- Time back for other priorities
- Tax-efficient exit if possible

### Trade-offs (Speed vs Price vs Certainty)
- Will trade max price for no-hassle exit
- Open to seller financing for right terms
- Will accept below retail for speed and certainty
- Values simplicity over optimization

### What They Want Off Their Plate
- Tenant management and calls
- Maintenance and repairs
- Active oversight
- Mental burden of ownership

---

## Openness to Creative Solutions

### Permission-Based Bridge Questions
- If you could be 100% hands-off but still benefit, would that work?
- What if the exit could be structured for tax advantage?
- Would ongoing income with zero work appeal to you?
- Are you open to exploring options beyond retail sale?

### If Openness is Low
Rare with tired landlords - they're usually highly open. If resistance, may need cash immediately or have trust issues. Explore why.

## Likely Objections (Translated)

### Objection: "What about capital gains taxes?"
**Protecting:** Wealth preservation, tax efficiency
**Risk Behind Objection:** Large tax hit on sale
**Control Question:** "Great question - would you be interested in structures that defer or reduce that?"

### Objection: "How do I know you'll actually make the payments?"
**Protecting:** Credit score, loan responsibility
**Risk Behind Objection:** Default risk if Subject-To
**Control Question:** "Smart concern - let me show you how this is structured and protected..."

### Objection: "Can I really be completely hands-off?"
**Protecting:** Fear of ongoing involvement
**Risk Behind Objection:** Still getting pulled back in
**Control Question:** "Yes - let me be specific about what hands-off means in our structure..."

### Objection: "Why would I do this vs selling retail?"
**Protecting:** Leaving money on table
**Risk Behind Objection:** Making suboptimal financial decision
**Control Question:** "Let's compare - retail means repairs, agent fees, time, and uncertainty. What's that worth?"

## False Beliefs & Limiting Stories

## Deal Structure Matching

### Structure: Seller Finance
**Best Fit:** Primary recommendation for tired landlord with equity
**Primary Lever:** Passive income stream + tax deferral + hands-off
**When NOT to Use:** Need immediate liquidity, unwilling to carry note

### Structure: Subject-To
**Best Fit:** If minimal equity but want immediate exit
**Primary Lever:** Complete relief from management with equity preservation
**When NOT to Use:** Substantial equity that should be monetized

### Structure: Cash
**Best Fit:** If they need full liquidity now
**Primary Lever:** Clean break, lump sum
**When NOT to Use:** Tax hit too large, would benefit from structure

## Common Closer Mistakes

### Mistake: Explaining too early
**Why:** Presenting structure before understanding pain removes leverage and creates confusion
**Instead:** Complete discovery fully - earn the right to present solutions

### Mistake: Leading with strategy
**Why:** Prospects care about relief, not mechanisms. Strategy-first creates skepticism
**Instead:** Lead with outcome transformation, explain structure only when asked

### Mistake: Selling terms instead of relief
**Why:** Terms are abstract. Relief is visceral. Wrong focus = low conversion
**Instead:** Anchor to their pain point and desired outcome, terms are delivery vehicle

### Mistake: Presenting Subject-To prematurely
**Why:** Without proper framing, Subject-To sounds risky or too good to be true
**Instead:** Build trust, demonstrate understanding, frame as proven solution
