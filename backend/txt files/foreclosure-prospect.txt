## Openness to Creative Solutions

### Permission-Based Bridge Questions

- What would prevent you from signing immediately?

### If Openness is Low
Should not exist in real foreclosure. If present, foreclosure may not be real or they don't understand severity. Verify situation immediately.

## Common Closer Mistakes

### Mistake: Explaining too early
**Why:** Presenting structure before understanding pain removes leverage and creates confusion
**Instead:** Complete discovery fully - earn the right to present solutions

### Mistake: Leading with strategy
**Why:** Prospects care about relief, not mechanisms. Strategy-first creates skepticism
**Instead:** Lead with outcome transformation, explain structure only when asked

### Mistake: Selling terms instead of relief
**Why:** Terms are abstract. Relief is visceral. Wrong focus = low conversion
**Instead:** Anchor to their pain point and desired outcome, terms are delivery vehicle

### Mistake: Presenting Subject-To prematurely
**Why:** Without proper framing, Subject-To sounds risky or too good to be true
**Instead:** Build trust, demonstrate understanding, frame as proven solution
