## Common Closer Mistakes

### Mistake: Explaining too early

**Instead:** Complete discovery fully - earn the right to present solutions

### Mistake: Leading with strategy
**Why:** Prospects care about relief, not mechanisms. Strategy-first creates skepticism
**Instead:** Lead with outcome transformation, explain structure only when asked

### Mistake: Selling terms instead of relief
**Why:** Terms are abstract. Relief is visceral. Wrong focus = low conversion
**Instead:** Anchor to their pain point and desired outcome, terms are delivery vehicle

### Mistake: Presenting Subject-To prematurely
**Why:** Without proper framing, Subject-To sounds risky or too good to be true
**Instead:** Build trust, demonstrate understanding, frame as proven solution
