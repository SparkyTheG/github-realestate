## Openness to Creative Solutions

### Permission-Based Bridge Questions

- Do you understand this may mean walking away with nothing but avoiding foreclosure?

### If Openness is Low
Rare in true distress. If present, they may not fully grasp situation severity or may have unrealistic rescue fantasy. Re-establish reality.

### Objection: "I need to get something out of this"
**Protecting:** Ego, avoiding feeling of total loss
**Risk Behind Objection:** Walking away with nothing feels like failure
**Control Question:** "I understand - what's more important: getting nothing and avoiding foreclosure, or foreclosure?"

### Objection: "What if I can figure something else out?"
**Protecting:** Hope that miracle will happen
**Risk Behind Objection:** Fear of making wrong choice
**Control Question:** "What specifically would that be, and how long do you have to make it happen?"

## Common Closer Mistakes

### Mistake: Explaining too early
**Why:** Presenting structure before understanding pain removes leverage and creates confusion
**Instead:** Complete discovery fully - earn the right to present solutions

### Mistake: Leading with strategy
**Why:** Prospects care about relief, not mechanisms. Strategy-first creates skepticism
**Instead:** Lead with outcome transformation, explain structure only when asked

### Mistake: Selling terms instead of relief
**Why:** Terms are abstract. Relief is visceral. Wrong focus = low conversion
**Instead:** Anchor to their pain point and desired outcome, terms are delivery vehicle

### Mistake: Presenting Subject-To prematurely
**Why:** Without proper framing, Subject-To sounds risky or too good to be true
**Instead:** Build trust, demonstrate understanding, frame as proven solution
