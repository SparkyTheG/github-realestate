# Test Scripts for Lubometer Testing

## HIGH SCORE TEST SCRIPT (Target: 70-90)

Use this script as the **PROSPECT** to test high Lubometer scores:

### Conversation Flow:

**Salesperson:** "How many months behind are you on payments?"

**Prospect (YOU):** "I'm 4 months behind on my mortgage payments. The auction is in 10 days and I'm absolutely terrified of losing my home. I can't sleep at night thinking about my family being homeless."

**Salesperson:** "What's your current loan balance versus property value?"

**Prospect (YOU):** "I owe about $280,000 and the house is worth around $320,000. I have $15,000 in savings that I could use right away. If this solves my problem, it's worth every penny. I'm not worried about the cost if it works."

**Salesperson:** "Why did this happen?"

**Prospect (YOU):** "I lost my job during COVID and couldn't catch up. I know I should have acted sooner, but I kept hoping things would get better. I take full responsibility for where I am now. It's on me to fix this."

**Salesperson:** "What would happen if this goes to auction?"

**Prospect (YOU):** "My family would be homeless. My kids would have to change schools. I can't let that happen. This is the most important thing to me right now - it's my top priority. I'm ready to make a decision today if this will work."

**Salesperson:** "Is there anyone else involved in this decision?"

**Prospect (YOU):** "No, it's my decision completely. I own the property and I'm ready to move forward right now. I trust you can help me. I've heard good things about you guys."

**Salesperson:** "What would it take for you to commit today?"

**Prospect (YOU):** "If I'm confident this will work and I can close quickly, I'm ready. I don't need to think about it or sleep on it. The price is fair if it solves my problem. I've been stuck for too long and I'm ready to move forward now. I trust myself to follow through on this."

## LOW SCORE TEST SCRIPT (Target: <30)

Use this script as the **PROSPECT** to test low Lubometer scores:

### Conversation Flow:

**Salesperson:** "How many months behind are you on payments?"

**Prospect (YOU):** "Um, not really that much. Maybe a month or two. It's not a big deal. We're just exploring options."

**Salesperson:** "What's your current loan balance versus property value?"

**Prospect (YOU):** "I don't really want to share that information. Why do you need to know? Can you just give me a ballpark number?"

**Salesperson:** "Why did this happen?"

**Prospect (YOU):** "It's not really my fault. The market is tough, buyers are flaky. Nothing I could do about it. It's just bad luck."

**Salesperson:** "What would happen if this goes to auction?"

**Prospect (YOU):** "Oh, I'm not really on a deadline. No rush. If it sells, great. If not, no big deal. I'm flexible."

**Salesperson:** "Is there anyone else involved in this decision?"

**Prospect (YOU):** "Yeah, I need to check with my wife first. And probably my parents too. Not really my decision alone. I'll need to get back to you after I talk to them."

**Salesperson:** "What would it take for you to commit today?"

**Prospect (YOU):** "Oh, I can't decide today. I need to think about it for a while. Can you drop the price a bit? It's too expensive. I'd need a better deal. Let me think about it and I'll get back to you in a few weeks."

## HIGH SCORE TEST SCRIPT #2 - DISTRESSED LANDLORD (Target: 70-90)

Use this script as the **PROSPECT** to test high Lubometer scores for a distressed landlord scenario:

### Conversation Flow:

**Salesperson:** "Tell me about your rental property situation."

**Prospect (YOU):** "I have a rental property that's been bleeding me dry for the past 8 months. The tenant stopped paying rent and has destroyed the place. I'm losing $2,500 every single month and I'm absolutely desperate to get out of this nightmare. This has consumed my entire life and I can't take it anymore."

**Salesperson:** "What's the current state of the property and your loan situation?"

**Prospect (YOU):** "The property is worth about $450,000 and I owe $380,000 on it. I have $25,000 in cash that I can access immediately. I need this solved now - I don't care about the price, I just need to stop the bleeding. If this gets me out of this situation, it's worth it."

**Salesperson:** "What have you tried so far?"

**Prospect (YOU):** "I've tried everything - lawyers, eviction attempts, mediation. Nothing has worked and I've wasted so much money. I realize now I waited too long and should have acted months ago. This is completely my fault for not handling it earlier, and I need to fix it myself. I'm the one who got into this mess."

**Salesperson:** "What happens if this situation continues?"

**Prospect (YOU):** "I'll lose the property completely. My credit will be ruined. I'll face foreclosure on my primary residence because I can't keep covering both mortgages. This has to be resolved immediately - it's the most critical issue in my life right now. I'm ready to move forward today if we can close fast."

**Salesperson:** "Who else needs to be involved in this decision?"

**Prospect (YOU):** "It's entirely my decision. I'm the sole owner and I have full authority to proceed. I've already made up my mind that I need to exit this property. I've researched your company and I trust you can help me. Several people recommended you for situations like this."

**Salesperson:** "What would it take for you to commit today?"

**Prospect (YOU):** "If you can guarantee a quick close and get me out of this property within 30 days, I'm 100% committed right now. I don't need to think about it or consult anyone. The terms are fine - I just need speed and certainty. I've been paralyzed by this for too long, and I'm ready to take action. I know I'll follow through because I have no other choice and I trust myself to make this decision."

## HIGH SCORE TEST SCRIPT #3 - CASH/EQUITY SELLER (Target: 70-90)

Use this script as the **PROSPECT** to test high Lubometer scores for a cash/equity seller scenario:

### Conversation Flow:

**Salesperson:** "What's prompting you to sell this property now?"

**Prospect (YOU):** "I need to sell this property immediately because I have another investment opportunity that's time-sensitive. I need to close within 21 days to secure the next deal, and every day that passes costs me the chance to move forward. This is critical for my investment strategy."

**Salesperson:** "What's your equity situation and how much cash do you need?"

**Prospect (YOU):** "I own the property free and clear - it's worth about $275,000 with no mortgage. I need at least $250,000 in cash within 3 weeks to make the next deal happen. I have additional funds if needed, but I need certainty and speed more than I need every last dollar. The price is less important than the timeline."

**Salesperson:** "What happens if you can't sell in time?"

**Prospect (YOU):** "I'll lose the investment opportunity completely and it will cost me tens of thousands in potential returns. I've already delayed other deals because of this, and I can't afford to wait any longer. This is my top priority right now - nothing else matters as much as closing this quickly."

**Salesperson:** "Have you tried listing it traditionally?"

**Prospect (YOU):** "Yes, I listed it 3 months ago and had two deals fall through. Buyers couldn't get financing and the whole process took forever. I realize now that speed and certainty are worth more to me than a few extra thousand dollars. I should have gone this route from the beginning. It's my mistake for not prioritizing correctly, and I need to fix it."

**Salesperson:** "Is there anyone else involved in this decision?"

**Prospect (YOU):** "No, this is entirely my call. I'm the sole owner and decision-maker. I don't need to consult anyone or get approvals. I've made my mind up - I want to proceed immediately. I've heard great things about your company's ability to close fast, and I trust that you can deliver."

**Salesperson:** "What would you need to move forward today?"

**Prospect (YOU):** "If you can guarantee a close within 21 days and give me a firm commitment, I'm ready to sign right now. I don't need to sleep on it or negotiate further. The terms work for me - I just need to move quickly. I've been waiting too long already, and I'm completely committed to getting this done. I trust myself to follow through because I know what's at stake."

## HIGH SCORE TEST SCRIPT #4 - TIRED/PERFORMING LANDLORD (Target: 70-90)

Use this script as the **PROSPECT** to test high Lubometer scores for a tired/performing landlord scenario:

### Conversation Flow:

**Salesperson:** "What's driving your decision to sell your rental property?"

**Prospect (YOU):** "I've been a landlord for 15 years and I'm completely burned out. I'm tired of dealing with tenants, maintenance calls at 2am, and spending every weekend working on the property. I want my life back and I'm ready to sell now. This has been weighing on me for months and I've finally decided enough is enough."

**Salesperson:** "What's the property's current financial situation?"

**Prospect (YOU):** "The property is worth around $520,000 and I owe $320,000 on it, so I have good equity. I have about $30,000 in cash available if needed. I'm not concerned about the price - I just want a smooth, fast transaction. If the numbers work and I can close quickly, I'm ready to move forward. I'd rather take a slightly lower offer for certainty and speed."

**Salesperson:** "What will you do with the proceeds?"

**Prospect (YOU):** "I need to close within 45 days because I'm retiring next month and I want this settled before I leave. This property is the last thing tying me down and I need it resolved before I can enjoy my retirement. It's become my top priority - more important than squeezing out a few extra dollars."

**Salesperson:** "Have you tried listing it traditionally?"

**Prospect (YOU):** "I listed it 4 months ago and had constant showings, lowball offers, and it just dragged on. I realize now I should have gone with a direct buyer from the start. I take full responsibility for wasting those months - I should have known better. It's my decision to fix this and I'm ready to act."

**Salesperson:** "Is there anyone else who needs to be involved in this decision?"

**Prospect (YOU):** "No, it's entirely my property and my decision. I don't need anyone's approval or permission. I've made up my mind that I want to sell and I'm ready to proceed immediately. I've done my research on your company and I trust you can handle this professionally."

**Salesperson:** "What would you need to move forward today?"

**Prospect (YOU):** "If you can commit to closing within 45 days and give me a firm closing date, I'm ready to sign today. I don't need to think about it or shop around. The price you're offering works for me - I value certainty over negotiation. I've been ready to sell for months, and I'm fully committed to getting this done now. I trust myself to follow through because I know this is what I want."
